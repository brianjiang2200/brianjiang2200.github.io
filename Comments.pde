/*TO DO

Implement Linked List of Protectors for the ProtectedSquare Class. 
	-For double checks and further engine evaluation. 
	-Need to figure out the issue with insertion sort.
	
Basic Evaluation Function 
	-Test Evaluations 
	
Move List 
	-First show move list and then store previous game positions. 

*/

/* IDEAS

Incorporate a custom position setup. 
	Invert colors function on custom board setup by setting whiteimg to blackimg and vice versa. 
	Don't change the actual colours. 

Need a menu with Analysis Mode, Training Mode, and Game Mode. 

Analysis mode: should have the option to not see engine evaluation. 

Game Mode: Increasing ply numbers. 
Recreate position(?) while not losing any material. Same position every time. 

IMPORTANT NOTES:
REMEMBER THAT THE BOARD IS NUMBERED FROM 0 to 7, not 1 to 8 
Integer division will not work the same when converted to JS, thus floor() should be used. 
The char datatype does not exist in JS, so all char datatypes were converted to String.
